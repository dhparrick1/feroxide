# feroxide
A basic chemistry simulator. [![Travis Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-page]

## Currently includes
- Basic functionality
  * Calculate mass of molecules
  * Generate (sometimes still incorrect) names of molecules
  * Check if reactions are valid
  * Get Atoms/Molecules/Ions/Reactions by inputting a string respresentation
  * Get the Standard Electrode Potential for Redox reactions

- Advanced functionality
  * Create containers with molecules or ions in them
  * Apply reactions to containers
  * Redox reactions


## Plans for the future
- GUI
- Reactions
  * Precipitation reactions
  * Acid/Base reactions
